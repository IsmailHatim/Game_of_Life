The Game of Life of John Conway using java

# Rules
The Game of Life initially invented by John Conway takes place in a 2D infinite matrix where the elements are called cells. A cell can be alive or dead (represented by a full or empty square).

Here are the rules according to wikipedia:

"Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead."
